//Usage code

// to compile Morten's code just type

>make 

and execute it by typing

./read_bin_irina /path_data_directory/filename.bin >> test.out

***For the ROOT macros there are two ways of running the macros

****(1) the usual way, just load the macro, execute the function inside and quit ROOT 

>root -l

root[1] .L CreateCDTTree.C
root[2] CreateCDTRootFile()
root[3].q

>root -l

root[1] .L analysis_cdt.C
root[2] analysis()
root[3].q

// at the end of these steps one should have two rootfiles available:
// cdt.root -> the main file with the data
// cdt_new_cal.root  -> the file with the positions of the voxels 

Open the ROOT file and look at the data: 

>root -l cdt.root


**********(2) the advanced way, by compiling the macros


To create a stand-alone program from the macro called analysis_cdt.C, simply type in a terminal window:

> g++ -o analysis analysis_cdt.C `root-config --cflags --libs`
 
 and execute it by typing:
 
>./analysis 

Do the same for the macro 'CreateCDTTree.C'

>g++ -o CreateCDTRootFile CreateCDTTree.C `root-config --cflags --libs`

> ./CreateCDTRootFile 

// same as above, at the end of these steps one should have two rootfiles available:
// cdt.root -> the main file with the data
// cdt_new_cal.root  -> the file with the positions of the voxels 

Open the ROOT file and look at the data: 

root -l cdt.root
